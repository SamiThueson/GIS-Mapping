# Overview

I started this project to learn what GIS Mapping was and how to implement it in software. I have had no prior experience to this project with any type of GIS Mapping. The purpose of this project was to help me experience and learn more as a software engineer.

I began writing the software in the script.js file in order to practice and understand how to write code for an ArcGIS map. I added some different features in that file that the ArcGIS website teaches you how to use. I wrote the software in the navi.js file after practicing with the other file, it displays different points on the map depending on what catagory you specify.

In order to display the map you will need to replace the api key with your own from the ArcGIS website. To run the code go to the html file and in the right hand corner press the Go Live button.

(The map had trouble loading so if you would like to skip 3:35-3:53 and 4:56-5:19 you will get through the video much faster.)

# Development Environment

I used vscode to develop and write the software. In order to view the map, since it is web based, you just press the Go Live button and it will display the map through chrome.

I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to write the software. To display the map I used the ArcGIS library and got an api key from the ArcGIS website.

# Useful Websites

- [ArcGIS API for Javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)
- [Google Maps for Longitude and Latitude](https://www.google.com/maps)
- [Javascript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

# Future Work

- Find someway to combine the different features in script.js and navi.js
- Track and display active lightning storms
- Make it an actual website that anyone can visit
